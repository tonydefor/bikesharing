# Bikesharing Challenge

# Overview

In this module, we explored Tableau, a data analysis and visualization tool that is nearly ubiquitous in today's professional world. Tableau is so popular because it allows data visualization to create assets that are visually appealing and easy for a non-technical audience to understand our presentation. Tableu helps us tell a clear story that can be easily shared with others.

This chart shows the time period that bikes are checked out for all riders in Des Moines. Our x-axis prtrays the time in minutes while our y-axis has the number of bikes. By looking at our chart, it is clear that the highest number of trips were of 5-minute durations.

By analyzing our visualization, we can see the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. Peak times were in the mornings between 8 am and 9 am and in the evenings between 5 pm and 7 pm. We can also tell by our visualization that slow times were between the hours of 12 am and 5 am. This could be because during those times, there's less foot traffic in town. This could also serve as a good point in time to service our bikes for any mechanical issues.

This particular sheet tells has also been designed as a heatmap to showcase the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week. We could think of this chart as an extension of the earlier chart.

Our final sheet has also been designed as a heatmap. This chart is specifically important as it helps us to identify growth opportunities. The company could enhance its market share by targeting the other genders based on our analyses.
